# 💦🌱🥕 AutomatedIrrigationSystem 
![](./doc/assets/cover_image.jpg)

Hi there 👋, nice to meet you! My name is Chris and when you found this repository, I assume 
that you probablly have the same problem as I have. I love vegetables and plants, but when 
it comes to gardening I am pretty 💩. Even tough it would take me not that much time to actually 
learn all this gardening stuff (hopfully no gardener will judge me to harsh based on this comment), 
the real developer spirit is to put in the effort now to be lazy in the future 😅. 
So I decided to make this fun side project to get better at coding and figure out how 
to make my plants grow. At the end I hope to have developed a functional System to plant my 
own vegetables. Wish me luck 🤞🏼.
